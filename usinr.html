# Brief Description

The data set contains `r ncol(BirthData)` variables measured on `r nrow(BirthData)` infants born in North Carolina. The variables of the dataset are as follows:

* Patient.ID
* Mother Minority
* Mother Age
* Marital Status
* Mother Smoker
* Gender
* Number of Prenatal Visits
* Birth Weight Grams

# Summary Statistics

Before diving into graphical procedures and corelation exploration, let's generate some general statistics and well define our data set. The following is a basic statistical summary of the 3 numeric variables we have in our dataset. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=6}
library(pastecs)
options(scipen=100)
options(digits=2)
Stats <- cbind(Mother.Age, Birth.Weight.Grams, Number.of.Prenatal.Visits)
stat.desc(Stats, basic=F)
```

As for the categorical variables:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=6}

#Gender:
transform(setNames(as.data.frame(table(BirthData$Gender)), c("Gender", 
"Count")), Percentage = paste0(100*Count/sum(Count), "%"))
#Ethnicity of Mothers:
transform(setNames(as.data.frame(table(BirthData$Mother.Minority)), c("Ethnicity", 
"Count")), Percentage = paste0(100*Count/sum(Count), "%"))
#Marital Status:
transform(setNames(as.data.frame(table(BirthData$Marital.Status)), c("Marital Status", 
"Count")), Percentage = paste0(100*Count/sum(Count), "%"))
#Smoker or not:
transform(setNames(as.data.frame(table(BirthData$Mother.Smoker)), c("Smoker", 
"Count")), Percentage = paste0(100*Count/sum(Count), "%"))

```

# Graphical Summaries

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width=4}
slices <- c(48.4,52.6)
lbls <- c("Male", "Female")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Pie Chart of Gender")
slices <- c(88.05,11.95)
lbls <- c("Smoker", "Non-Smoker")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Pie Chart, Smoker vs Non-Smoker")
plot(BirthData$Mother.Minority)
plot(BirthData$Marital.Status)
boxplot(BirthData$Mother.Age, ylab="Mother's Age", main="Boxplot of Mother's Age")
boxplot(BirthData$Birth.Weight.Grams, ylab="Birthweight", main="Boxplot of Birthweight")
plot(BirthData$Number.of.Prenatal.Visits, xlab="Number of Prenatal Visits", main="Histogram of Prenatal Visits")

```

# Investigating relationships
Boxplotting the Smoker vs Non-Smoker against Birth Weight. From the plot, it seems that mothers who smoke generally have babies which weigh less after birth.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width=4}
plot(BirthData$Mother.Smoker,BirthData$Birth.Weight.Grams, ylab = "Birth.Weight.Grams",xlab="Smoker: Yes or No", pch=19) 
```

Carrying out a regression we can determine some interesting things; such as some important factors while determining birthweight are Mother.Smoker, Age etc.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width=4}
fit <- lm(Birth.Weight.Grams ~ Mother.Minority + Mother.Age + Mother.Smoker
          + Gender, data=BirthData)
summary(fit)
plot(fit)
```
